  - `config/`: Project configuration
  - `core/`: Main application
- `venv/`: Virtual environment (not tracked in git)

## ✨ Features

- 📱 Clean and organized Django 5 structure
- 🛠️ Separation of settings and application code
- 📦 Ready to use with frontend frameworks
- 🔒 Admin interface for content management

## JavaScript/React Analogies

For developers coming from a JavaScript/React background, here are some helpful analogies:

| Django | JavaScript/React |
|--------|------------------|
| Project structure | Create React App structure |
| `config/` directory | Configuration files (webpack, babel) |
| `settings.py` | `.env` files and config options |
| Django apps (core) | React components/modules |
| Templates | JSX components |
| URLs | React Router |
| Models | Data structure definitions |
| Django ORM | Prisma, Mongoose, etc. |
| `requirements.txt` | `package.json` |

## Next Steps

Once you have this basic structure set up, you might want to:

1. Add more models to expand your data structure
2. Create class-based views for more complex operations
3. Add authentication and user management
4. Set up static files for CSS, JavaScript, and images
5. Consider adding Django Rest Framework for API development
6. Integrate with frontend frameworks like React or Vue

This structure is particularly well-suited for gradual expansion and maintaining separation of concerns as your project grows.
